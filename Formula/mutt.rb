# Note: Mutt has a large number of non-upstream patches available for
# it, some of which conflict with each other. These patches are also
# not kept up-to-date when new versions of mutt (occasionally) come
# out.
#
# To reduce Homebrew's maintenance burden, patches are not accepted
# for this formula. The NeoMutt project has a Homebrew tap for their
# patched version of Mutt: https://github.com/neomutt/homebrew-neomutt

    mutt_dotlock(1) has been installed, but does not have the permissions lock
    spool files in /var/mail. To grant the necessary permissions, run

      sudo chgrp mail #{bin}/mutt_dotlock
      sudo chmod g+s #{bin}/mutt_dotlock

    Alternatively, you may configure `spoolfile` in your .muttrc to a file inside
    your home directory.
